To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing asking for consideration towards changes to the wording of the
"INCITS/PL22.16 - Programming Language {CPP} Charter". Which is currently stated as:

[quote]
____
Task Group PL22.16 (formerly J16) is responsible for the technical development of the standard for the {CPP} programming language. The goal of this project is to make it possible for {CPP} programs to be highly portable among different operating systems and across a wide variety of computers. High level of compatibility with the ISO C standard and suitability for the International community are two associated goals established by PL22.16 that will help to extend the useful life of this standard and increase the audience of its users.

This Task Group is the U.S. TAG to ISO/IEC JTC 1 SC22/WG21.
____

The charter, as written, has served its purpose of directing the group squarely
on advancing the language to exciting heights. But in being direct it has
circumscribed the tasks that PL22.16 can accomplish to problematic lows.
In a time when the language is advancing, the community is struggling to
manage the challenges of the complexity and variability of the tools,
technologies, and systems that make {CPP} possible (i.e. the {CPP}
ecosystem).

It is time we acknowledge that the continued success of {CPP} is tied not
solely to the language. But that the {CPP} ecosystem and interoperability
within that ecosystem are key to surmounting the challenges of further growth
of the language for the benefit of its users.

As such we ask that the charter of PL22.16 be explicitly adjusted to encourage
development of standards to support the {CPP} language and ecosystem.
A possible expanded charter:

Thank you for the opportunity to voice our concerns and for your consideration
of this matter.
